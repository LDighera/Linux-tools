# Security Tools

Scripts for auditing permissions, monitoring users, and strengthening system security.  
These utilities prioritize transparency and simplicity over external dependencies.

**Examples:**
- `fix_perms.sh` — Template: make root's local bin directory files executable.
- `file-permissions-check.sh` — identify world-writable files.
- `password-policy.sh` — summarize current password requirements.
