# Storage Tools

Tools for managing disks, partitions, mounts, and backups.  
Focus on safe inspection and automation of storage tasks.

**Examples:**
- `show_disks.sh` — display storage device tree and labels.
- `show_drives.sh` — display pages of storage information.
- `backup-image.sh` — create compressed images of partitions or drives.
